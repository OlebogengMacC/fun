They are designed in such manner that the entrance itself became a non-return device, allowing the fish to enter the trap but making it impossible to leave the catching chamber.
Traps are divided into:

The certification, simple and understandable by all, is the result of a collective approach of actors who wish to work together to promote the ""produce in France"" and the valorization of industrial and artisan know-how.

The Pro France association which promotes Origine France Garantie is made up of business leaders supporting this initiative. Its goal is:

Give clear and precise information to the consumer about the French origin of the products
Make known the companies that manufacture in France
The Origine France Garantie certification distinguishes itself from other mentions such as ""made in France"", ""designed in France"", ""Made in France"" ... which are self-declarative and too loose.

Origine France Garantie is the only certification that certifies the French origin of a product. It is transversal (all sectors combined) and indisputable (certification, mandatory, is carried out by an independent certifying body).

The Origine France Garantie certification ensures consumers traceability of the product by giving a clear and objective indication of origin.

Certification is achieved through two cumulative criteria that companies must meet to obtain it:

Between 50% and 100% of the unit cost is French
The product takes its essential characteristics in France",CODEVALUE,GDSN,,NEW,CURRENT,9
